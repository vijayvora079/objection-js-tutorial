# Additional to verify the migration and seeding

- `npm run migrate`: executes all migrations in `./db/migrations`
- `npm run seed`: Insert all data into the table from `./db/seed`
- `npm run down`: undo last migration. Since we only have one migration at the moment this is equivalent to deleting all tables
